## faq
### who are you?
thmux8ai is a non-profit organization created by [themirrazz][https://github.com/themirrazz] dedicated to bringing ai bangers to your doorstep. thmux8ai can refer to either the thmux8ai brand, which is an artist name that acts as a front for ai generated songs, and the thmux8ai label, which manages and publishes songs that come out of the thmux8ai front.

### what is your setup?
we use 4 accounts all on the free tier of suno. you can create suno accounts at [https://suno.com/create]. we use 4 seperate accounts because each free-tier account supports making 50 credits (5 songs) per day. however we dont make a song per day, which means there are credits from the past that were never used. however due to suno limits, the credits of the free tier can only be filled up to 50. the other 2-3 accounts dont completely make up for those lost credits, but they make up for it enough for us.

### do you work with other artists?
yes, in fact, themirrazz, the creator of this organization is a starting music artist himself.
